<h1>Long COVID (Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19)</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
Long COVID, also called Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), occurs when symptoms persist for weeks, months, or years after the initial COVID-19 infection. It can affect anyone regardless of initial infection severity — even people with mild or asymptomatic COVID can develop Long COVID. 
</p>
<p>
It is a multi-system condition affecting the heart, lungs, brain, nervous system, and other organs. Symptoms can fluctuate, worsen with activity, and significantly impact daily functioning. Long COVID shares similarities with ME/CFS and other post-viral conditions.
</p>

<h2>Why is it “invisible”?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Crushing fatigue that doesn't improve with rest</li>
    <li>Post-exertional malaise (PEM) — crashes after minimal activity</li>
    <li>“Brain fog” affecting memory, concentration, and thinking</li>
    <li>Shortness of breath and chest pain</li>
    <li>Rapid heart rate and palpitations (often POTS)</li>
    <li>Dizziness and difficulty standing</li>
    <li>Muscle and joint pain</li>
    <li>Headaches and pressure sensations</li>
    <li>Sleep disturbances despite exhaustion</li>
    <li>Loss of taste and smell that persists</li>
    <li>Anxiety and depression from chronic symptoms</li>
    <li>Exercise intolerance — what used to be easy becomes impossible</li>
</ul>

<h2>The daily reality</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Needing to rest after showering or simple tasks</li>
    <li>Planning activities around limited energy reserves</li>
    <li>Crashing for days or weeks after “overdoing it”</li>
    <li>Feeling like you're aging rapidly or losing your mind</li>
    <li>Being unable to work or attend school consistently</li>
    <li>Missing important life events due to unpredictable symptoms</li>
    <li>Looking fine while feeling like you're dying inside</li>
    <li>Dealing with doctors who dismiss or minimize Long COVID</li>
    <li>Losing jobs, relationships, and financial stability</li>
    <li>Grieving your pre-COVID health and capabilities</li>
    <li>Living in fear that you'll never fully recover</li>
    <li>Feeling isolated because others think COVID is “over”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common misconceptions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>“COVID is over, move on”</strong> — Long COVID can last years and affects millions</li>
    <li><strong>“You just need to exercise more”</strong> — Exercise worsens PEM and can cause severe crashes</li>
    <li><strong>“It's just anxiety about COVID”</strong> — Long COVID causes measurable physiological changes</li>
    <li><strong>“You didn't have severe COVID, so you're fine”</strong> — Mild initial infection can still cause Long COVID</li>
    <li><strong>“It only lasts a few weeks”</strong> — Many people have symptoms for months or years</li>
    <li><strong>“You look fine, you must be better”</strong> — Long COVID is invisible but severely disabling</li>
    <li><strong>“Just push through it”</strong> — Pushing through causes Post-Exertional Malaise and worsens the condition</li>
</ul>

<h2>What people with Long COVID want you to know</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Our fatigue is not laziness — it's a neurological symptom</strong></li>
    <li><strong>We didn't “just catch a cold” — COVID changed our bodies</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Brain fog makes us seem confused or slow — it's terrifying for us</strong></li>
    <li><strong>We're grieving who we were before COVID</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Many doctors don't know how to treat us or don't believe us</strong></li>
    <li><strong>We may need years to recover, not weeks</strong></li>
    <li><strong>We're not being dramatic — we're fighting for our lives</strong></li>
    <li><strong>“Good days” don't mean we're cured — symptoms fluctuate</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>How you can help</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Believe us when we describe our symptoms and limitations</li>
    <li>Don't pressure us to “get back to normal” on your timeline</li>
    <li>Understand that we may need to cancel plans due to crashes</li>
    <li>Be patient with our brain fog and memory issues</li>
    <li>Don't suggest exercise as a cure — it can make us worse</li>
    <li>Offer specific help: groceries, meals, transportation</li>
    <li>Support our need for rest and pacing</li>
    <li>Advocate for Long COVID research and medical recognition</li>
    <li>Don't dismiss our experience because “everyone had COVID”</li>
    <li>Remember that invisible doesn't mean imaginary</li>
</ul>

<p>
Long COVID affects an estimated 10–30% of people who had COVID-19, with millions of Americans currently living with Long COVID. It can affect anyone regardless of age, previous health status, or severity of initial infection. Research is ongoing, but recovery timelines vary widely and some may face permanent disability.
</p>

<h2>💙 To our Long COVID warriors</h2>
<p>
Your symptoms are real, your struggle is valid, and you are not alone. You didn't choose this, and you're not weak for not “bouncing back.” Your body went through a serious illness and needs time to heal. Be patient with yourself, pace carefully, and know that the Long COVID community stands with you. Recovery is possible, even if it takes longer than anyone expected.
